Validations ? 


What are they ? A series of methods that return true or false (boolean) that check for specific things based on the condition you have placed on it. (Example, A Username cannot be blank.)

Why do we use them ? A way to ensure that only proper information will be sent and saved within our DB

What do we use them on?

Validations in active record can only be used on methods that CREATE something. Example ( If you user User.new or User.create user.valid?)

rollback transaction(  which tells you that what you are trying to save was not successful ) user.error.full_messages
